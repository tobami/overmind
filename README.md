# Overmind

This project aims to provider a complete server provisioning and configuration management application.

The first version is a *unified front-end* to public and private clouds, custom server providers and dedicated hardware.

## Features

* EC2 and Rackspace server provisioning. All clouds supported by libcloud will be supported given enough testing
* Provider Plugins: Any provider can be integrated by writing either a libcloud driver or an Overmind provisioning plugin
* Import any server into Overmind witht the "Dedicated Hardware" plugin
* Complete REST API for provider and nodes
* Authentication with three user roles

See the wiki for architectural info and to know more about the future direction of the project.
